In port-specific news, the Amiga and Mac ports have again changed the
most, both in user interface for the previously existing windowing
systems and in adding support for "tty" windowing.  The MS-DOS versions
may now use direct screen I/O instead of going through termcap routines,
and be compiled for NEC PC-9801 machines thanks to Yamamoto Keizo.
The SYSV 386 music driver was ported to 386BSD by Andrew Chernov and
SCO by Andreas Arens.

In general news, the pickup and disclosure options were enhanced;
information on the new usage is available from the Guidebook and
intra-game options help.

A number of bugs were fixed, of which the most commonly encountered
fatal ones were associated with cursed bags of holding, renaming
shopkeepers, objects falling through trapdoors on deep levels, and
kicking embedded objects loose.

As usual, bones and save files from previous versions should be discarded
when upgrading to 3.1.2.
