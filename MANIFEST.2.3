Update 2.3 Manifest

     This file contains a list of all files required to perform an update
of your program.  Files in the manifest can be divided into three separate
catagories.

     1) New files which are, of course, included in full.

     2) Patches to existing files in cases where the length of the
        patch file does not exceed that of the updated source code.

     3) Updated source modules in cases where the patch file would
        have been longer.  These are included in full.

     In addition, there is a shell script which will allow you to back up
copies of files in category (3) above to "filename.orig" format files.
