Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.
Compound options which can be set during the game are:

packorder	a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
		order in which your pack will be displayed
		If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
		default order will be appended to the end.  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
endgame		the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
		You choose a combination of top scores, scores around that of
		the ending game, and all of your own scores.
		[!own/3 top/2 around]
fruit		the name of a fruit you enjoy eating
		(basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time)
		[slime mold]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

name		the name of your character
		[obtained by asking the system or the player]
dogname		the name of your first dog  [NONE]
catname		the name of your first cat  [NONE]
 
graphics	a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
		drawing the dungeon
		The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
		that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
		indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
		As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
		Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
		given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes.
		[stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')
		vwall hwall tlcorn trcorn blcorn brcorn       (room boundaries)
		crwall tuwall tdwall tlwall trwall  (wallified maze characters)
		vbeam hbeam lslant rslant			    (zap beams)
		ndoor vodoor hodoor cdoor   (no, vert-open, horiz-open, closed)
		room corr upstair dnstair trap web pool
		fountain sink throne altar
		upladder dnladder vdbridge hdbridge]
