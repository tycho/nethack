Behold, mortal, the origins of NetHack...

Jay Fenlason wrote the original Hack with help from Kenny Woodland,
Mike Thome, and Jon Payne.

Andries Brouwer did a major re-write and published (at least) three versions
(1.0.1, 1.0.2, and 1.0.3) for UNIX(tm) machines to the Usenet.

Don Kneller ported 1.0.3 Hack to Microsoft(tm) C and MSDOS(tm), producing
PC HACK 1.01e, added support for DEC Rainbow graphics in version 1.03g,
and went on to produce at least four more versions (3.0, 3.2, 3.51, and 3.6).

R. Black ported PC HACK 3.51 to Lattice(tm) C and the Atari 520/1040,
producing ST Hack 1.03.

Mike Stephenson merged these various versions back together, incorporating
many of the added features, and produced NetHack version 1.4.  He then
coordinated a cast of thousands in enhancing and debugging NetHack 1.4 and 
released NetHack versions 2.2 and 2.3.  Later, he coordinated a major rewrite
of the game, heading a team which included Ken Arromdee, Jean-Christophe
Collet, Steve Creps, Eric Hendrickson, Izchak Miller, John Rupley, Mike
Threepoint, and Janet Walz, to produce NetHack 3.0. 

Olaf Seibert ported NetHack 2.3 and 3.0 to the Amiga.

 
From time to time, some depraved individual out there in netland sends a
particularly intriguing modification to help out with the game.  The Gods of
the Dungeon sometimes make note of the names of the worst of these miscreants
in this, the list of Dungeoneers:

    Tom Almy                  Eric Hendrickson       Izchak Miller
    Ken Arromdee              Bruce Holloway         Gil Neiger
    Eric Backus               Richard P. Hughey      Eric S. Raymond
    John S. Bien              Greg Laskin            John Rupley
    Ralf Brown                Steve Linhart          Kevin Sweet
    Jean-Christophe Collet    Roland McGrath         Scott R. Turner
    Steve Creps               Bruce Mewborne         Janet Walz

    and...                    The Unknown Hacker
