Move commands and modifiers:
yuhjklbn: go one step in specified direction
YUHJKLBN: go in specified direction until you
          hit a wall or run into something.
[CTRL]<dir>,
g<dir>:   run in direction <dir> until something
          interesting is seen.
[SHIFT]<dir>,
G<dir>:   same, except a branching corridor isn't considered
              interesting.
m<dir>:   move without picking up objects.

For all Macintosh keyboards the [command] key (apple or pretzel key)
functions as the [control] key and the [~] key functions as the [escape]
key. The normal [control] and [escape] keys are also supported.

The Number Pad
When the window title shows "[MOVE]", the number keys may also be used
to move your character, otherwise they act as a numeric keypad.

The '5' key on the numberpad invokes the "open door" command.
The '0' key on the numberpad invokes the "do inventory" command.

The 'g', 'G', '[SHIFT]', [CTRL] and 'm' modifiers may also be used with
the numberpad and the cursor keys.

Press the clear key (or Num Lock) on the number pad to enable or disable
using the number pad for movement.

The Cursor
Although NetHack was meant to be played from a keyboard, on the Macintosh
you can essentially play NetHack using the mouse. The mouse cursor shows
which direction you will try to move if you press the mouse button when
the mouse is in the Nethack window. Of course, if you're confused this may
be different. You may use the 'g', 'G', '[SHIFT]' and 'm' modifiers with
the mouse button, too. Note that [SHIFT]-clicking on the spot where you're
standing will "look" at the objects piled there. Holding down the mouse
button will, after a delay, cause repeated moves in the indicated direction.

The cursor will at times also indicate your current state of well-being.
These auxiliary cursors may look better on a non-inverted screen (they
look best against the standard white Macintosh background). The cursor
madness can be controlled from the "Set Options" dialog (see below).

Alerts
Occasionally a mac alert will appear in response to some action of yours.
These mac alerts typically require a "yes" or "no" (or alternate) response.
You can accept the default response button (indicated by a surrounding
hilite) by clicking on that button, hitting return or typing the first
letter of that button (i.e. y for yes). The alternate response(s) can be
chosen by clicking on them or typing their first letter, appropriately.

Macintosh-specific Options
MultiFinder AutoZoom: when enabled shrinks the NetHack window to icon size
when the game is context-swapped out and restores the window upon return.

Alternative Cursors: when enabled allows the standard NetHack arrow cursor
set to be replaced by "hands" while blind a/o "strange" cursors while
hallucinating, if not blind, and so on. This does not affect the randomly
oriented cursors that appear when you're confused or stunned. A fatal
skull-n-crossbones cursor set will appear if you become deathly sick.

The other NetHack options are described elsewhere under the "?" command.
The names may be slightly different on the options dialog.

Miscellaneous
The option key is the meta-key. For option-n, press option-shift-n and
for option-u, press option-shift-u.
