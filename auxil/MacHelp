If the window title shows "[MOVE]", the number keys move your character,
otherwise they act as a numeric keypad.
The 'g', 'G', '[SHIFT]' and 'm' modifiers may also be used with the
numberpad and the cursor keys.
The mouse cursor shows which direction you will try to move if you
press the mouse button when the mouse is in the Nethack window.  You may
use the 'g', 'G', '[SHIFT]' and 'm' modifiers with the mouse button too.
The '5' key on the numberpad invokes the "open door" command.
The '0' key on the numberpad invokes the "do inventory" command.

For pre-ADB keyboards (Mac+ keyboards and earlier), use the Command key
for the Control key and the "`" (backquote) key for the escape key.

Press the clear key (on the numberpad) to switch between movement mode
and numeric keypad mode.

The option key is the meta-key. For option-n, press option-shift-n and
for option-u, press option-shift-u.
