We wish to thank the many people who sent us bug reports, fixes, and
suggestions for improvements.  Please keep doing this.

More polish was applied to the Amiga, Mac, and X11 windowing systems.
X11 WM_DELETE_WINDOW handling was added by David Wexelblat.  As we said
in the initial release, the Mac and the Amiga ports are still in
development.  You will find them to be much improved, but there is more
work to be done.  Make constructive comments.

The instrument sound files were broken out from their Mac-specific format
and are now being used by the Amiga port.

A Windows NT console port was provided by Michael Allison.

Various portability fixes for more UNIX makes and HPUX versions.

Many small bugs were fixed.  Some of the most popular include misconfiguring
windowing systems, the wrong phase of the moon for some micro ports,
polymorphing into bees, "ghosts" left by reeling monsters, throwing Mjollnir
at walls, various problems with shop payment, mysterious rust damage on damp
levels, Bells of Opening for Tourists, and bones on endgame levels.

Many, many small changes having to do with message phrasing (thanks to
Felix Lee) and Amiga declaration syntax for their new compiler version
(transparent to other ports).

Please NOTE:  Old save/bones files should be deleted.  They will NOT
work with NetHack 3.1.1.
