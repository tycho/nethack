There are further boolean options that exist in some versions of NetHack
3.1.  (You can learn which options exist in your version by checking your
current option setting, which is reached via the 'O' cmd.)

Boolean option if INSURANCE was set at compile time:
checkpoint save game state after each level change, for possible  [TRUE]
           recovery after program crash

Boolean option if NEWS was set at compile time:
news       print any news from game administrator on startup      [TRUE]

Boolean options if DGK was set at compile time:
BIOS       allow the use of IBM ROM BIOS calls                    [FALSE]
rawio      allow the use of raw I/O (may only be set on startup)  [FALSE]

Boolean option if EXP_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:
showexp    display your accumulated experience points             [FALSE]

Boolean option if SCORE_ON_BOTL was set at compile time:

Boolean options if TEXTCOLOR was set at compile time:
color      use different colors for objects on screen   [TRUE for micros]
hilite_pet if color is FALSE, display pets in a highlighted way   [FALSE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

disclose      the types of information you want offered at the end of the
              game  [all]
fruit         the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
              (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]
scores        the parts of the score list you wish to see when the game ends
              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

catname    the name of your first cat  [NONE]
dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
graphics   a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')
           vwall hwall tlcorn trcorn blcorn brcorn      (room boundaries)

           vbeam hbeam lslant rslant                  (generic zap beams)
           digbeam flashbeam      (special beams for digging and cameras)
           boomleft boomright                                (boomerangs)
           ss1 ss2 ss3 ss4                           (shielding sequence)
           sw_topl, sw_topm, sw_topr,                  (swallow, top row)
           sw_midl, sw_midr,            (swallow, middle row [no center])
           sw_botl, sw_botm, sw_botr                (swallow, bottom row)

           exbl exbm exbr                   (explosion matrix bottom row)
monsters   like graphics, but for monster symbols
           default:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
                     ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@\ \\&;:~]

name       the name of your character  [obtained by asking the system or
           the player]
objects    like graphics, but for object symbols
           default:  ])[="(%!?+/$*`0_.
pettype    your preferred type of pet (cat or dog), if your character
           class uses both types  [RANDOM]
