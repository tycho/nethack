== Compilation instructions for UnNetHack ==

Windows user need to install an development environment as detailed in 
the NetHack-Cygwin-MinGW HOWTO[2].


On Linux and MacOSX for a single-user installation (a Linux Debian
 or Ubuntu system needs the packages gcc, flex, bison, make,
 libncurses5-dev and autotools-dev installed):

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/unnethack --with-owner=`id -un` --with-group=`id -gn` --enable-wizmode=`id -un` && make && make install


On Windows for a tty build (replace Username and Usergroup with your local
 settings):
 ./configure --prefix=$HOME/unnethack --with-owner=Username --with-group=Usergroup --build=mingw32 --disable-file-areas --without-compression --enable-tty-graphics && make && make install


 The game will be started with ~/unnethack/bin/unnethack
