UnNitroHack
===========

UnNitroHack is an experimental merge of two modern NetHack variants: NitroHack
and UnNetHack.

It combines NitroHack's...

    - new terminal interface
      * persistent inventory and message windows
      * HP and power bars
      * Unicode and layered tiles
    - dungeon overview
    - full key remapping
    - fine-grained autopickup rules
    - saved in-game options
    - multiple saved in-progress games
    - game replays and dump logs
    - interface-agnostic network play

... with UnNetHack's...

    - new levels, items and monsters
    - new item, monster and dungeon feature interactions
    - new powers and effects for existing items
    - new playable vampire race and convict class
    - new dungeon branches, rooms and shop types
    - tutorial mode
    - dozens of interface improvements, e.g.
      * dim spaces outside of line-of-sight
      * auto-open doors
      * autopickup can ignore dropped items and grab thrown items
      * paranoid prompts for actions that are usually bad
      * Ctrl-E to engrave Elbereth
    - many community patches
    - rebalanced gameplay
      * Gehennom completely reworked with open caverns and lava rivers
      * randomized dragon names and appearances
      * less free wishes, farming and exploits

UnNitroHack is compiled the same way as NitroHack. To compile UnNitroHack with
debugging symbols (for stack traces under gdb, useful for bug reports):

    1) Install dependencies:
      - the usual NetHack dependencies
        * C compiler
        * flex
        * bison
      - NitroHack interface and client dependencies
        * ncursesw (NCurses with wide character support)
        * jansson (JSON support for client to play on remote servers)
        * zlib (save log compression)
      - NitroHack build dependencies
        * cmake
        * cmake-curses-gui (a.k.a. ccmake, optional but recommended)
    2) 'mkdir build && cd build'
    3) 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..'
    4) Configure your build with ccmake/cmake-curses-gui
      - 'ccmake .'
      - Edit paths by choosing lines with enter.
      - Press 'c' to rerun configuration with your new paths.
      - Press 'g' to generate and save your build configuration.
      - Or press 'q' to cancel or quit if you're happy with the defaults.
    5) 'make && make install'
    6) Run the 'unnitrohack' bootstrap script to play.
      - Settings are stored under ~/.config/NitroHack if you want to change
        Unicode glyphs or view dump logs.

UnNitroHack can be compiled to run natively on Windows using MinGW; see
doc/build-mingw.md for details.

Alternately, to build UnNitroHack with Cygwin for Windows:

    1) Install Cygwin with these packages selected:
      - gcc4 (gcc may also work)
        * libmpfr4 (needed for gcc4 only, if it's not already selected)
      - make
      - cmake
      - flex
      - bison
      - libncursesw-devel
      - git
      - zlib-devel
    2) Install Jansson for Cygwin:
      - Download source tarball from http://www.digip.org/jansson/.
      - Extract to C:\cygwin\home\foo where foo is whatever's already there.
      - Open 'Cygwin Terminal' from the desktop shortcut and type (no quotes):
        * 'cd jansson-2.4'
        * './configure'
        * 'make'
        * 'make install'
    3) Get the UnNitroHack source code (still in Cygwin Terminal):
      - 'cd ~'
      - 'git clone -b unnethack git://github.com/tung/NitroHack.git unnitrohack'
      - 'cd unnitrohack'
      - Follow the usual build instructions above from step 2 onwards.

The Cygwin Terminal (mintty) is like the Windows console (cmd.exe), but supports
Unicode characters, more fonts (I recommend Liberation Mono), dark gray (set it
in UnNitroHack's options), unrestricted window size, a choice of cursor style
and more; just right click and choose "Options...".


To build UnNitroHack on OS X:

    1) Install the Homebrew and the Command Line Tools for Xcode
      - Homebrew: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
      - Xcode (or the Command Line Tools): http://developer.apple.com/downloads
    2) Install dependencies via Homebrew:
      - brew install jansson cmake
    3) Ncursesw provided by Homebrew-dupes is currently buggy: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/issues/43
      - Until that bug is merged upstream, you'll need to install the patched version:
       * brew install https://gist.github.com/gcatlin/3098450/raw/8cc12bc4d095e654876744cdfa6eb57a24186589/ncurses.rb
    4) Get the UnNitroHack source code:
      - 'cd ~'
      - 'git clone -b unnethack git://github.com/tung/NitroHack.git unnitrohack'
      - 'cd unnitrohack'
    5) Build:
      - Set the installation location:
       * export NH_INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/unnitrohack
      - mkdir build
      - cd build
      - cmake -DUSE_OSX_HOMEBREW_CURSES=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  -DSHELLDIR=$NH_INSTALL_DIR -DBINDIR=$NH_INSTALL_DIR/data -DDATADIR=$NH_INSTALL_DIR/data -DLIBDIR=$NH_INSTALL_DIR/data ..
      - make
      - make install
