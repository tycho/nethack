UnNitroHack
===========

UnNitroHack is an experimental merge of two modern NetHack variants: NitroHack
and UnNetHack.

It combines NitroHack's...

    - new terminal interface
      * persistent inventory and message windows
      * HP and power bars
      * Unicode and layered tiles
    - dungeon overview
    - full key remapping
    - fine-grained autopickup rules
    - saved in-game options
    - multiple saved in-progress games
    - game replays and dump logs
    - interface-agnostic network play

... with UnNetHack's...

    - new levels, items and monsters
    - new item, monster and dungeon feature interactions
    - new powers and effects for existing items
    - new playable vampire race and convict class
    - new dungeon branches, rooms and shop types
    - tutorial mode
    - dozens of interface improvements, e.g.
      * dim spaces outside of line-of-sight
      * auto-open doors
      * autopickup can ignore dropped items and grab thrown items
      * paranoid prompts for actions that are usually bad
      * Ctrl-E to engrave Elbereth
    - many community patches
    - rebalanced gameplay
      * Gehennom completely reworked with open caverns and lava rivers
      * randomized dragon names and appearances
      * less free wishes, farming and exploits

UnNitroHack is compiled the same way as NitroHack. To compile UnNitroHack with
debugging symbols (for stack traces under gdb, useful for bug reports) and
without its server (which is only useful if you want to host the game for
others to play):

    1) Install dependencies:
      - the usual NetHack dependencies
        * C compiler
        * flex
        * bison
      - NitroHack interface and client dependencies
        * ncursesw (NCurses with wide character support)
        * jansson (JSON support for client to play on remote servers)
      - NitroHack build dependencies
        * cmake
        * cmake-curses-gui (a.k.a. ccmake, optional but recommended)
    2) 'mkdir build && cd build'
    3) 'cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DENABLE_SERVER=FALSE ..'
    4) Configure your build with ccmake/cmake-curses-gui
      - 'ccmake .'
      - Edit paths by choosing lines with enter.
      - Press 'c' to rerun configuration with your new paths.
      - Press 'g' to generate and save your build configuration.
      - Or press 'q' to cancel or quit if you're happy with the defaults.
    5) 'make && make install'
    6) Run the 'unnitrohack' bootstrap script to play.
      - Settings are stored under ~/.config/NitroHack if you want to change
        Unicode glyphs or view dump logs.

To build UnNitroHack with Cygwin for Windows:

    1) Install Cygwin with these packages selected:
      - gcc4 (gcc may also work)
      - make
      - cmake
      - flex
      - bison
      - libncursesw-devel
      - git
    2) Install Jansson for Cygwin:
      - Download source tarball from http://www.digip.org/jansson/.
      - Extract to C:\cygwin\home\foo where foo is whatever's already there.
      - Open 'Cygwin Terminal' from the desktop shortcut and type (no quotes):
        * 'cd jansson-2.4'
        * './configure'
        * 'make'
        * 'make install'
    3) Get the UnNitroHack source code (still in Cygwin Terminal):
      - 'cd ~'
      - 'git clone -b unnethack git://github.com/tung/NitroHack.git unnitrohack'
      - 'cd unnitrohack'
      - Follow the usual build instructions above from step 2 onwards.

The Cygwin Terminal (mintty) is like the Windows console (cmd.exe), but supports
Unicode characters, more fonts (I recommend Liberation Mono), dark gray (set it
in UnNitroHack's options), unrestricted window size, a choice of cursor style
and more; just right click and choose "Options...".
