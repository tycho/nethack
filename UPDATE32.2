This is a minor bugfix release.  Sorry, no major new functionality this
time around.

The two bugs found by dozens of people, recover not working and boomerangs
sometimes causing crashes, are fixed.  A problem with priest names in the
endgame found by several people is fixed.  Dozens of other mostly minor
bugs noticed by one person each are fixed, and some minor extensions added.

Several people's problems with curses.h when compiling for UNIX/tty
should be fixed as well.

Save files are not compatible with earlier versions -- various session-
specific flags are no longer stored in the save file, instead of trying
to ignore their saved values when restoring.  NetHack should diagnose
this instead of crashing mysteriously, however.

In port news, Mac mrecover is updated, although the windowing still needs
help from a Mac programming expert.  There has been some Amiga work, although
more people with time are needed there.  None of us have access to an
Atari any longer, so if anyone wants that port to continue this is a good
time to make yourself known.  (The UNIX, VMS, MS-DOS, and NT ports are
reasonably healthy, modulo people getting busy.)
