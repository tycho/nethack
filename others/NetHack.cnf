# This configuration file is set up for two cases, for a hard disk
# (as drive C:), and for two floppy disks.
#
# To change the configuration, comment out the unwanted lines, and
# uncomment the configuration you want.


# *** OPTIONS ***
#
# These two options should be used for most setups.  If you're machine isn't
# very IBM-compatible, and NetHack doesn't work, try commenting out this line.
#
OPTIONS=rawio,IBM_BIOS,IBMgraphics
# DEC Rainbows will hang if rawio is set, so they should instead use:
#OPTIONS=IBM_BIOS,DECgraphics
#
#
# Some options to set personal preferences.  Uncomment and change these to
# suit your personal preference.  If several people are to use the same
# configuration, options like these should not be set.
#
#OPTIONS=name:Janet-V,female,dogname:Fido,catname:Morris,fruit:apricot
#OPTIONS=packorder:")[%?+/=!(*0_`,endgame:10 top/2 around/own
#
#
# Other general options.  You might also set "silent" so as not to attract
# the boss's attention.
#
OPTIONS=time,rest_on_space,nopickup,number_pad


# *** HARD DISK CONFIGURATION ***
#
HACKDIR=c:\games\nethack
#
#   LEVELS and SAVE default to HACKDIR
#
#LEVELS=c:\games\nethack\bones
#SAVE=c:\games\nethack\bones;n
#
#   appending a ";n" to SAVE means don't prompt to insert a disk.

# *** 2-FLOPPY CONFIGURATION ***
#
# HACKDIR=a:\
# LEVELS=b:\
# SAVE=b:\
# RAMDISK=c:


# *** CHARACTER GRAPHICS ***
#
# The 32 GRAPHICS characters (0-31) are:
# stone, vertical wall, horizontal wall, top left corner, top right corner, 
# bottom left corner, bottom right corner, crosswall, up T wall, down T wall, 
# left T wall, right T wall, vertical beam, horizontal beam, left slant, right
# slant, no door, vertical open door, horizontal open door, closed door,
# floor, corridor, up stairs, down stairs, trap, web, pool,
# fountain, sink, throne, altar, up ladder, down ladder, vertical drawbridge
# wall, horizontal drawbridge wall 
#
# If you specify less that 35 ASCII values, the remaining characters will be
# set to their respective defaults.
#
# If you merely set the IBMgraphics option as above, NetHack will use IBM
# extended ASCII for dungeon characters.  If you don't like the selections,
# you can make up your own via the graphics option, but you should still set
# IBMgraphics if you are using IBM graphics characters to get the correct
# processing.
#
# An example using the IBM graphics character set:
#	   ' '  |   -   .   .   `   '   -   -   -   -   -   |   -   \   /   .   -   |   +   .   #   <   >   ^   "   }   {   #   \   _   <   >   #   #

#
# Using the DEC Rainbow/ANSI line-drawing character set:
#
# If you have compiled with TERMLIB, merely set the DECgraphics option as
# above.  NetHack will then switch into the VTxxx line-drawing character set
# (aka ANSI ruling character set '0') for dungeon characters.  If you don't
# like the selections, you can make up your own via the graphics option,
# adding 128 to the value of any line-drawing character you want to use.
# (But you should still set DECgraphics to get the correct processing.)
