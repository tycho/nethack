Here is a list of known issues with the curses interface at the time of
this writing.  Send any others you discover to me (Karl Garrison) at
kgarrison@pobox.com, along with how to reproduce the problem, if
possible.  Missing features are listed in the file Todo.txt.

 * Resizing a window to 80 columns or less causes a crash (PDCurses for
 SDL and X11 only).  Windows starting at this size and below do not
 cause a crash, however.
