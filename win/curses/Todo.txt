NetHack Interface

   (These are the functions in cursmain.c called by the core NetHack code)
     * Implement curses_rip for optional fancier color tombstone, as well
       as one that will display correctly on smaller terminals.

     * I am confused as to how mark_synch and wait_synch should work. Help,
       please?

     * Both PDCurses and Ncurses have mouse support, so the poskey
       function could probably be implemented easily enough.

     * raw_print is supposed to be able to work before the windowing
       system has been initialized, as well as after, so I am unsure if
       curses functions should be used here. Maybe check to see if
       initscr() has been called, and use curses functions if so, and call
       initscr() from there is not? Right now it is just a call to puts()
       with no support for bold text.

Display

     * Consolidate refreshes of the display for smoother output.

     * Calls to getch() should probably be turned into wgetch() for the
       appropriate window. This causes quirky cursor behavior under
       PDCurses, however.

     * Support option to set foreground and background colors for
       individual windows

Menus

   (cursdial.c)

     * Currently the "preselected" flag for an individual menu item is
       ignored. This should eventually be implemented.

     * Menus probably should never overlap with the message window, since
       the user sometimes needs to be able to see the messages while the
       menu is active, e.g. when identifying multiple items one at a time.

     * Perhaps allow for keyboard navigation of individual items, e.g.
       using the up and down arrows to move among the selectable items,
       and selecting individual items with the spacebar. Perhaps the tab
       key could jump to the first selectable item after the next heading,
       and shift-tab could jump to the first item of the previous heading.


Map Window

   (curswins.c)
     * This is something fairly silly and whimsical, but it seems like it
       would be fun to have a "tiles mode" of sorts for the curses port
       that used ASCII-art "tiles".

Status Window

   (cursstat.c)
     * Maybe add some configuration options for what colors are used and
       the like.

Other Dialogs

   (cursdial.c)
     * Extended commands should be enterable letter-by-letter via a '#'
       prompt if user does not have the extmenu command set to TRUE.

     * Character selection should allow for a random selection of any or
       all choices.

Other Platforms

   PDCurses also work on DOS and OS/2. PDCurses for SDL and ncurses exist
   for Mac OS X. Porting the curses interface to these platforms should
   not be too difficult.

Misc

     * Update documentation and in-game help to describe the newly-added
       options: cursesgraphics, term_rows, term_cols, and windowborders.

     * PDCurses has a function named "addrawch" to output the visual
       representation of a control character to the screen without having
       the control character affect the display otherwise. I would like to
       find a way to accomplish the same thing via Ncurses to e.g. be able
       to use a font like nh10 with the correct symbol mappings in an
       xterm or the like. (maybe impossible on a real terminal?)

     * Convert nh10.bdf text font into a format that PDCurses-SDL can use.

     * Allow all transient windows to be moved with arrows, possibly with
       modifier keys for multipage dialogs.
