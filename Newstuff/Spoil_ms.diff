The Spoilers.mm distributed from the Nethack 2.3 upgrade kit is written
with the -mm macros, which I don't have access to.  I've modified the
document for the -ms package.  It's not perfect, but it's good enough
for me.  To apply the patch, do:

	1. Save everything below the cutoff line into Spoilers.diff
	   and move it to the directory containing Spoilers.mm
	2. Copy Spoilers.mm to Spoilers.ms: cp Spoilers.mm Spoilers.ms
	3. Use the patch program: patch Spoilers.ms < Spoilers.diff
	4. Format it using nroff, troff, psroff, ptroff, etc.:
		ex: tbl Spoilers.ms | nroff -ms > Spoilers.txt
