NetHack 3.2.0 was built with Metrowerk's DR7 compiler on a PPC system.
The official 68K and PPC versions were compiled with PowerPC Alignment
to share files (Why not 68K alignment? -- Because the space saving is
small and the PowerPC version will run better.).  The 68K version
was compiled with 4 byte ints using the far model.
 
Only the Metrowerks compiler has been used to compile the code in a
long time.  It is _very_ likely that the other compilers, Think C and
MPW C, will no longer be able to compile NetHack out of the box.  They
and their files have been moved to the "old" directory until such time
that someone can compile with them.
