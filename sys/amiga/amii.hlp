            Amiga specific help file for NetHack 3.1.3

The Amiga port of NetHack supports a number of additional commands
and facilities specific to the Amiga.  Listed below are the things
which are either specific to the Amiga port or might not appear
in other ports.

While playing NetHack you can press:

        ALT-HELP                To activate the palette editing
                                requester.  Saved games include
                                these settings of the pens to allow
                                the game to be resumed with the
                                same palette at a later date.

Separate Icon types for saved games:
                                Each character class can have a
                                separate icon.  The first letter
                                of the character class is used
                                for deriving the name.  e.g. a
                                Wizard saved game would use
                                Nethack:w.icon if it is present.
                                The NetHack:default.icon is used
                                if the associated character class
                                icon is not present.
