# Monitors vary greatly in their color response.  If the default colors
# are not good on your monitor, here are some other alternatives:
#CBM 1960, set color/contrast for good pure red, green, and blue. True colors.
#PENS=000,fff,a61,7bb,0f0,e0c,00f,f00
#CBM 1960, set color/contrast as above, better colors for NetHack.
#PENS=667,fff,da1,7bb,2f0,e0d,0af,f42
#and one other suggestion:
#PENS=888,ffc,840,0b8,4e4,e8b,7be,a04
PENS=000,fff,830,7ae,181,c06,23e,c00
# for an "interlaced"+ line screen, the default is courier:13.  If you want
#  a different font, set it here.  The format is "fontname.font:size"; i.e. the
# .font extension is required.
#FONT=topaz.font:13
# Proportional fonts such as CGTimes are probably not a good idea because they
# result in many things not being spaced out correctly.
#FONT=CGTimes.font:15
# This sized proportional font is readable, but still has spacing problems
#FONT=CGTimes.font:21
