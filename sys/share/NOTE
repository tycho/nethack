The files lev_yacc.c, lev_lex.c, lev_comp.h, dgn_yacc.c, dgn_lex.c
and dgn_comp.h in this directory were generated on a Sun, using byacc
(4.4BSD yacc) and flex, and were placed here for the convenience of
those who do not have native lex/yacc on their system.

These files, while widely tested, are NOT guaranteed to work on all
systems.  In particular, the flex output files (lev_lex.c and dgn_lex.c)
are known NOT to work on the Macintosh, when using MPW (they do work
with Think C).  If you use MPW, and you do NOT have native lex to generate
your own files, do one of the following:  Either (a) get/generate these
files from/on a UNIX system, using standard lex (not flex), or (b) seek
the files from another Macintosh/MPW owner, who has lex on his system.
Sorry, but that's the best we can do now.
