#
# This configuration file is set up for two cases, for a hard disk
# (as drive C:), and for two floppy disks.
#
# Some options MUST be set in this file, other options can be toggled while
# playing.  For a list of options available see the <opthelp.> file.  If
# the game plays slowly you might notice some improvement by setting
# !time and !showexp, which will reduce screen I/O somewhat.
#
# To change the configuration, comment out the unwanted lines, and
# uncomment the configuration you want.


# *** OPTIONS ***
#
# These two options should be used for most setups.  If you're machine isn't
# very IBM-compatible, and NetHack doesn't work, try commenting out this line.
#
OPTIONS=rawio,BIOS,IBMgraphics
# DEC Rainbows will hang if rawio is set, so they should instead use:
#OPTIONS=BIOS,DECgraphics
#
#
# Some options to set personal preferences.  Uncomment and change these to
# suit your personal preference.  If several people are to use the same
# configuration, options like these should not be set.
#
#OPTIONS=name:Janet-V,female,dogname:Fido,catname:Morris,fruit:apricot
#OPTIONS=packorder:")[%?+/=!(*0_`,scores:10 top/2 around/own
#
#
# Other general options.  You might also set "silent" so as not to attract
# the boss's attention.
#
OPTIONS=time,rest_on_space,noautopickup,number_pad


# *** HARD DISK CONFIGURATION ***
#
HACKDIR=c:\games\nethack
#
#   LEVELS and SAVE default to HACKDIR
#
#LEVELS=c:\games\nethack\bones
#SAVE=c:\games\nethack\bones;n
#
#   appending a ";n" to SAVE means don't prompt to insert a disk.
SAVE=;n
#
# Note that RAMDISK must *not* be the same (or even implicitly
# get expanded to the same path by the OS) as HACKDIR.
#
#RAMDISK=d:


# *** 2-FLOPPY CONFIGURATION ***
#
# HACKDIR=a:\
# LEVELS=b:\
# SAVE=b:\
# RAMDISK=c:


# *** CHARACTER GRAPHICS ***
#
# The 69 GRAPHICS characters (0-68) are:
#
# stone,
# walls: vertical, horizontal,
#	 4 corners: top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right,
#	 cross wall,
#	 4 T walls: upward, downward, left, right,
# doors: no door,
#	 open doors: vertical, horizontal,
#	 closed doors: vertical, horizontal,
# floor,
# corridors: unlit, lit,
# stairs up, stairs down, ladder up, ladder down,
# trap, web, altar, throne, sink, fountain, pool/moat, ice, lava,
# lowered drawbridge: vertical, horizontal,
# raised drawbridge: vertical, horizontal,
# air, cloud, water,
# 4 beams: vertical, horizontal, left slant, right slant,
# digging beam, camera flash beam, left boomerang, right boomerang,
# 4 magic shield display symbols,
# 8 swallowed: top left/middle/right, mid left/right, bottom left/mid/right,
# 9 explosion: [3 rows (top, middle, bottom) of 3 characters]
#
# If you specify fewer that 69 ASCII values, the remaining characters will be
# set to their respective defaults:
#	   ' '  |   -   -   -   -   -   -   -   -
#           |   |   .   -   |   +   +   .   #   #
#	    <   >   <   >   ^   "   _   \   #   {
#	    }   .   }   .   .   #   #  ' '  #   }
#	    |   -   \   /   *   !   )   (   0   #
#	    @   *   /   -   \   |   |   \   -   /
#	    /   -   \   |  ' '  |   \   -   /
#
# If you merely set the IBMgraphics option as above, NetHack will use IBM
# extended ASCII for dungeon characters.  If you don't like the selections,
# you can make up your own via the graphics option, but you should still set
# IBMgraphics if you are using IBM graphics characters to get the correct
# processing.
#
# An example using the IBM graphics character set:
#GRAPHICS= 032 179 196 218 191 192 217 197 193 194 \
#	   180 195 249 239 239 254 254 249 177 177 \
#	   060 062 060 062 094 157 220 190 035 244 \
#	   247 249 247 042 042 186 205 046 035 247 \
#	   179 196 092 047 042 033 041 040 048 035 \
#	   064 042 047 045 092 058 058 092 045 047 \
#	   047 045 092 058 032 058 092 045 047
# An alternative:
#GRAPHICS= 032 186 205 201 187 200 188 206 202 203 \
#	   185 204 249 239 239 254 254 249 177 177 \
#	   060 062 060 062 094 034 095 092 035 244 \
#	   247 249 247 042 042 179 196 046 035 247 \
#	   179 196 092 047 042 033 041 040 048 035 \
#	   064 042 047 045 092 058 058 092 045 047 \
#	   047 045 092 058 032 058 092 045 047
#

#
# Using the DEC Rainbow/ANSI line-drawing character set:
#
# If you have compiled with TERMLIB, merely set the DECgraphics option as
# above.  NetHack will then switch into the VTxxx line-drawing character set
# (aka ANSI ruling character set '0') for dungeon characters.  If you don't
# like the selections, you can make up your own via the graphics option,
# adding 128 to the value of any line-drawing character you want to use.
# (But you should still set DECgraphics to get the correct processing.)
#
#GRAPHICS= 032 248 241 236 235 237 234 238 246 247 \
#	   245 244 248 241 092 047 254 241 248 043 \
#	   254 225
