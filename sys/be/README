This file is sys/be/README.  It is for those intending to compile
NetHack 3.2.1 on a BeBox running BeOS 1.1d7.  An actual game
has never been run due to the (current) lack of an uncrippled
linker.


BeBox NetHack currently only supports the TTY windowing system.  In
order to compile it, it would benefit you greatly to think of your Be
system as a unix variant.  It is possible to compile using the
Metrowerks IDE -- the Mac port of Nethack uses the Metrowerks compiler.
However, there are four executables and several steps involved in making
NetHack.  Unless you are extremely familiar with the build sequence, I
suggest you avoid it for now.  Let the Unix Makefiles take care of all
that for you.


From a freshly unpacked source tree:

1. Copy the Makfiles in sys/unix to their proper spots.  If you
   don't know what they are, read sys/unix/Install.unx.

2. Edit src/Makefile:
	o Change System to SysBe.
	o Comment out the Unix versions of SYSSRC and SYSOBJ variables.
	o Uncomment the Be versions of SYSRC and SYSOBJ.
	o Uncomment the BeBox versions CC, CFLAGS, LD, and LFLAGS.
	o Comment out the default CFLAGS and LFLAGS.
	o Change WINTTYLIB to be -ltermcap.

3. Edit util/Makefile:
	o Uncomment the BeBox versions of CC and CFLAGS.
	o Comment out the default CFLAGS and LFLAGS.
	o Change YACC and LEX to be bison -y and flex respectively.

4. Edit include/config.h to change HACKDIR to be the location of your
   install directory.  You may want to uncomment the DLB define.

5. Edit Makefile and change GAMEDIR to match HACKDIR in include/config.h.
   Make sure the path to GAMEDIR exists.

6. Type make install at the top level.



It is quite likely that some necessary steps needed to make the
game have been omitted.  Feel free to ad-lib as necessary.
