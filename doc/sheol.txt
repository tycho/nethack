Sheol - The icy cold netherworld.
(c) 2012 Mikko Juola


        Sheol is a branch in Gehennom that features more danger and less
        tediousness.

        It adds:

        - Ice walls and crystal ice walls
                They act like normal walls but can be melted with a wand
                of fire. Crystal ice walls can't be dug.

        - Ice traps
                Like fire traps but ice you instead.

        - New monsters:
                crystal golem, ice golem, black angel, blinker, Punisher,
                white naga and the Executioner. Each of these have abilities
                not seen in vanilla.

        - New items:
                crystal pick

        - New levels:
                Sheol has a new map generator and some hand-made levels.
                Sheol has 15 levels at maximum.

        Vlad has been put inside Sheol. It will be found somewhere below
        the middle level of Sheol.

        This branch is aimed at experienced players who think Gehennom is too
        easy or too tedious. It provides a refreshing change to all those 
        mazes.
