Sheol - The icy cold netherworld.
(c) 2012 Mikko Juola


        Sheol is a branch in Gehennom that features more danger and less
        tediousness.

        It adds:

        - Ice walls and crystal ice walls
                They act like normal walls but can be melted with a wand
                of fire. Crystal ice walls can't be dug.

        - New monsters:
                crystal golem, ice golem, black angel, blinker, punisher,
                white naga and the Executioner. Each of these have abilities
                not seen in vanilla.

        - New items:
                crystal pick, scythe

        - New levels:
                Sheol has one new map generator and two hand-made levels.
                Sheol has 15 levels at maximum.

        - New challenges:
                There's no natural HP regeneration in Sheol.


        Vlad has been put inside Sheol. It will be found somewhere below
        the middle level of Sheol.

        This branch is aimed at experienced players who think Gehennom is too
        easy or too tedious. Sheol is potentially even harder than the Astral
        Plane.
