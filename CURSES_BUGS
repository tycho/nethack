If compiled together with tty, color doesn't work in the curses GUI

There are more options than the curses GUI can handle. It labels the
options from a-z and then from A-Z and the rest of the options are all
labeled Z.

If decgraphics is set in the options file, the display isn't correct.
Setting cursesgraphics and IBMgraphics to true and false fixes the
display.
