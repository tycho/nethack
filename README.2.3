			    NetHack V2.3 README

	This file contains information on the 2.3 release of NetHack.  For
information on previous releases, see the README and README.OLD files.  For
a detailed history of the game, see the README.ORIG file, which contains
three separate readme files, dating back to the original release of the game
(then named "hack") by Jay Fenlason.

			HOW TO INSTALL THIS RELEASE

	To install this release, unpack all of the shar kits.  You will find
you have a bunch of completely new files, a second bunch of files with a
".new" suffix (these are all files which have been released fully, since the
patch file to update them would have been larger than the file itself), a set
of update patches - context diffs, and finally a shell script to pull every-
thing together.

	Next ***BACK EVERYTHING UP***.  I don't want to receive irate mail
about missing files due to some finger error.

	Read "Update.sh".  This script will be used once - and only once -
to perform the copies and cat's required to make the update.   Once it has
been run, all of your ".new" files will be moved onto their corresponding
".c" and ".h" files, and the originals will be backed up with a ".orig"
suffix.  All of the files which were shipped in parts will be concatenated
into one file.  And finally Update.sh will be removed. 

	Next run patch(1) with the file Update.2.3 as it's stdin.  This will
patch the remaining files up to 2.3e standard.  Gods help you if you've done
any patching on your own.  It probably won't work in that case.  Best bet is
to start with a virgin 2.2 release.

	Finally, copy "Makefile.<whatever>" to "Makefile", modify "config.h"
to suit and run "make".  Install it as you wish.


			    Release Discription

	This release of the game contains a large number of bug fixes, as
well as several new features.  There has been a large amount of play-testing
done on this release.  For a detailed list of bug fixes, and additions look
at the file "Fixes.2.3".  I cannot guarantee that every modification done has
been included, but I have done my best to chronicle the changes and fixes
made there.  Here are the high points:

  1)	New flags in "config.h":

	SAC		Soldiers & barracks code
	SHIRT		Hawaiian shirt code
	THEOLOGY	Smarter gods & sacrifices
	STOOGES		Three wild and crazy guys
	SINKS		Kitchen Sinks

	SCORE_ON_BOTL	Score (not exactly # of exp) on the bottom line.

	In addition, in an MSDOS enviornment:

	TERMLIB		enable use of termcap file c:\etc\termcap
			or .\termcap.cnf for MSDOS

	Of the above, I haven't tested TERMLIB.  If you find bugs in these,
send me the reports.

  2)	New objects:

	Hawaiian shirts (sort of armor - especially for tourists).

	Kitchen Sinks - for the dropping of rings, of course...

	Wand of Lightning

	Ring of Shock Resistance (to balance above)

	A named weapon (dagger or short sword) "Sting" a la Tolkien.

	Lamps and Magic Lamps

	A Badge to identify you as an "Officer".

  3)	New Files:

	A new makefile for the ATT 3B2

	A "Spoilers" manual in mm format and tables for the manual.

	The long-awaited documentation on nansi.sys - nansi.doc.

  4)	Major game changes:

	- Shop generation has been cleaned up.  There are now up to four
	different types of object inside.  There has also been modifications
	to room generation to make things cleaner.

	- A new type of room, the barracks (a lair for soldiers) has been
	added.  In addition, the soldier has been made just a little less
	deadly to compensate for the large numbers present.

	- A new type of trap, the landmine, (which will be renamed to con-
	form with a fantasy setting in the future) has been added.

	- A change to shopkeepers has them getting angry more easily if you
	are wearing a badge, and have robbed them.

	- The "dragon" has been split up into several sub-types.  They now
	have all sorts of breath weapons - NOTE: a slight bug - eating any
	of the dead dragon types still gives you intrinsic fire resistance.

	- A new wand, and compensating ring have been added (Lightning).

	- The "Giant Eel" has been replaced with an "Electric Eel".

	- The wand zapping code has been re-written (mostly in buzz()) so
	that support for new zap effects will be easier in the future.

	- Chameleon shape changes are now dependant on the level for more
	challenge.

	- An optional "logfile" has been added for game debugging.

	- Some interesting changes to the "pray" code have been added.

	- The restmonchn() code has been merged between Unix and MS-DOS.
	This results in a fair sized reduction in size and complexity of
	that particular module.  Please send me any bug reports as I have
	only tested it on the Unix side.

	- The colour <--> gemstone type code has been fixed so that the
	colour of an unknown stone now approximates the gem type.

	- For those who like a little fun, three STOOGES have been added
	(optionally) to the game.  They will show up and fight with each
	other, producing more of a disturbance than any serious trouble.

	- Lamps have been added.  When applied, they will light a room.

	- Magic lamps have a djinn inside.  Glowing potions may too.

	- A new monster, the Gremlin, can multiply in water, and will
	potentially steal your hard won inate attributes.

  5)	Minor game changes:

	- The fountain code has been modified to allow coins to fall into or
	be recovered from a fountain.

	- In wizard mode, the wizard player can now map the level, list all
	of his/her attributes, and can do a detect for all traps and doors.

	- When wishing, you are no longer limited by the x3/+3 rule.  However,
	you can't be sure that a "greedy" wish will produce the desired
	results, the object might be cursed.

	- You can now optionally print your score on the bottom line.  The
	score printed is close to what would show up on your tombstone.

	- A fix to allow multiple machine play via NFS on a shared playground
	has been made.  This won't affect us single machine players.

	- The time between prayers is now random.

	- Wizard and Medusa levels are now dependant on the MAXLEVEL param.

	- The spell list is now displayed in the corner.

  6)	Future additions:

	See the "Hackers.doc" file.  I am going to make the next release
a major modification of the code (3.0).  It will include as many alternate
OSs supported as I can get patches for.  It will also be constrained towards
a "fantasy" approach to the game.
